# TV-Series-downloader-for-index-based-websites
This project is created to automating the process of downloading multiple files one after another without manual effort

For testing, I had used an index based website to download the Ultimate Spiderman series(url to the website is there in the python file as a comment). The program download the files with proper series adn episode numbers and download it in the current project folder. 

Please help us edit it to make it better which could fit in downloading any kind of tree structured index based websites.
