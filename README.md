# TV-Series-downloader-for-index-based-websites
This project is created to automate the process of downloading multiple files one after another without manual effort

For testing, I had used an index based website to download the Ultimate Spiderman series(url to the website is there in the python file as a comment). The program downloaded the files with accurate series and episode numbers and downloaded it in the current project folder. 

Please help us upgrade it to make it work for downloading any kind of tree structured index based websites.
